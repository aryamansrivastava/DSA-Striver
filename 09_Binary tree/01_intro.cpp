// Binary Tree: Tree having at max 2 childrens

// Types of Binary Tree:
// 1. Perfect BT
// 2. Complete BT
// 3. Full BT
// 4. Balanced BT
// 5. Degenerate or Skew Tree

// 1. Perfect BT: 
// all leaf nodes are at same level.

// 2. Complete BT: 
// i. all levels are completely filled except the last level.
// ii. the last level has all nodes in left as possible.

// 3. Full BT: 
// all nodes has either 0 or 2 childrens.

// 4. Balanced BT:
// height of tree at max log(n), where n = no. of nodes in tree
// Or
// absolute difference of heights of left and right subtrees at any node is less than or equal to 1

// 5. Degenerate(or Skew) Tree:
// every node as only either 0 or 1 children.
