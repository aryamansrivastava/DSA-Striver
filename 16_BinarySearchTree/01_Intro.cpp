// Condition for Binary Search Tree (BST)

// 1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
// 2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
// 3. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

// Difference Between Binary Search Tree (BST) and Binary Tree (BT)

// BST -> Average Time Complexity of CRUD Operation is O(log(n))
// BT -> Average Time Complexity of CRUD Operation is O(n)
